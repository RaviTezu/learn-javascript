function Foo(){
  this.name = "Hello World";
  this.say  = function(){
    console.log(this.name);
  };
}

var foo = new Foo();
foo.say(); //Prints Hello World

var boo = foo.say;
boo(); // prints undefined and "this" is "window" here, so if there's any global variable which is defined with the name name, it will be printed here. 

Foo.apply(foo,[]); //Prints Hello World

Difference between apply and call is that, call accepts the arguments list and where as apply accepts only array of arguments. 

Bind accepts the object.
