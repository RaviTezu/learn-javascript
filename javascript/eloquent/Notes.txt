- In javascript functions are the only things that create a new scope. You are allowed to use free-standing blocks.

- The 'delete' operator can delete a object property. It is a unary operator that, when applied to a property access expression, will re-move the named property from the object. This is not a common thing to do, but it is possible.
Ex: > var obj1 = {"FirstName":"RaviTeja", "LastName":"Pothana"}
    > delete obj1.LastName
    > console.log(obj1.LastName)
      undefined 

- The binary 'in' operator, when applied to a string and an object, returns a Boolean value that indicates whether that object has that property.
Ex: > console.log("FirtName" in obj1)
      true
